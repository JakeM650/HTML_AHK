# HTML AutoHotKey Tools

Shortcuts for typing HTML tags because I am lazy.

 Example: turns `<body>` into `<body></body>`
                `<h1>` into `<h1></h1>`
                `<img>` into `<img src=""></img>`

#### Usage (If you really don't know what you're doing):
  1. [Download AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
  2. Once installed right click on your desktop and create a new AutHotKey Script
  3. Name the script and open it in a text editor
  4. Paste the text from [html_tools](https://github.com/camaradaJake/HTML_AHK/blob/master/html_tools) and save
  5. Run the Script
